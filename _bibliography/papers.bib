   title={DeepBrainPrint: A Novel Contrastive Framework for Brain MRI Re-Identification},
   author={Puglisi, Lemuel and Eshaghi, Arman and Parker, Geoff and Barkhof, Frederik and Alexander, Daniel C and Ravi, Daniele},
   abstract={Recent advances in MRI have led to the creation of large datasets. With the increase in data volume, it has become difficult to locate previous scans of the same patient within these datasets (a process known as re-identification). To address this issue, we propose an AI-powered medical imaging retrieval framework called DeepBrainPrint, which is designed to retrieve brain MRI scans of the same patient. Our framework is a semi-self-supervised contrastive deep learning approach with three main innovations. First, we use a combination of self-supervised and supervised paradigms to create an effective brain fingerprint from MRI scans that can be used for real-time image retrieval. Second, we use a special weighting function to guide the training and improve model convergence. Third, we introduce new imaging transformations to improve retrieval robustness in the presence of intensity variations (i.e. different scan contrasts), and to account for age and disease progression in patients. We tested DeepBrainPrint on a large dataset of T1-weighted brain MRIs from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and on a synthetic dataset designed to evaluate retrieval performance with different image modalities. Our results show that DeepBrainPrint outperforms previous methods, including simple similarity metrics and more advanced contrastive deep learning frameworks.},

   title={An efficient semi-supervised quality control system trained using physics-based MRI-artefact generators and adversarial training}, 
   author={Daniele Ravi and Frederik Barkhof and Daniel C. Alexander and Lemuel Puglisi and Geoffrey JM Parker and Arman Eshaghi},
   abstract={Large medical imaging data sets are becoming increasingly available, but ensuring sample quality without significant artefacts is challenging. Existing methods for identifying imperfections in medical imaging rely on data-intensive approaches, compounded by a scarcity of artefact-rich scans for training machine learning models in clinical research. To tackle this problem, we propose a framework with four main components: 1) artefact generators inspired by magnetic resonance physics to corrupt brain MRI scans and augment a training dataset, 2) abstract and engineered features to represent images compactly, 3) a feature selection process depending on the artefact class to improve classification, and 4) SVM classifiers to identify artefacts. Our contributions are threefold: first, physics-based artefact generators produce synthetic brain MRI scans with controlled artefacts for data augmentation. This will avoid the labour-intensive collection and labelling process of scans with rare artefacts. Second, we propose a pool of abstract and engineered image features to identify 9 different artefacts for structural MRI. Finally, we use an artefact-based feature selection block that, for each class of artefacts, finds the set of features providing the best classification performance. We performed validation experiments on a large data set of scans with artificially-generated artefacts, and in a multiple sclerosis clinical trial where real artefacts were identified by experts, showing that the proposed pipeline outperforms traditional methods. In particular, our data augmentation increases performance by up to 12.5 percentage points on accuracy, precision, and recall. The computational efficiency of our pipeline enables potential real-time deployment, promising high-throughput clinical applications through automated image-processing pipelines driven by quality control systems.},
