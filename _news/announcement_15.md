## Our Work on MS Subtyping
In December 2025, we (Queen Square Analytics [QSA], UCL, and MSD Serono) published a paper in *Brain* describing two data-driven subtypes of multiple sclerosis. These subtypes, termed **Early-sNfL** and **Late-sNfL**, characterise disease progression using a combination of blood biomarkers (serum neurofilament light chain, sNfL) and MRI measures, including brain atrophy, T1/T2 ratio, and lesion accrual.

The paper can be found here: [link](https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/148/12/4578/8321558).

## Global Reach
In late December, the paper was featured in *The Guardian*, after which it received coverage from a wide range of international media outlets. Below is a table summarising some of the newspapers and media sources identified online.
