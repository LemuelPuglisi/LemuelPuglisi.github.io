*PhD student at University of Catania and Imaging Research Scientist at Queen Square Analytics.*

**Short bio**. I graduated cum laude with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Catania in July 2021, and I have completed my Master's degree in Computer Science, specializing in data science, also with a cum laude distinction from the same institution in April 2023. I started my internship at Queen Square Analytics in September 2022 and have joined the QSA team as an imaging research scientist since March 2023. From August 2023, I have started my PhD at University of Catania on *data-driven neurodegenerative disease progression modeling* under the supervision of Prof. [Daniele Rav√¨](https://daniravi.wixsite.com/researchblog?lang=it). In February 2025, I joined the [MANIFOLD lab](https://manifold-lab.netlify.app/) at UCL as a visiting researcher, under the supervision of Prof. [James Cole](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/32379-james-cole).

My research interests center around the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to medical imaging with a focus on the study of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Multiple Sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease.
